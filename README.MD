## The Breakfast Club
A game we made for Software Engineering Class with a group of 3 other people

This project was made using the **Greenfoot Framework** as required. The game consists of two players, a waffle, and pancake. Each character is equipped with a gun which shoots projectiles represented by butter. Once a character's health goes down to 0, the character has lost and the opponent will win.

**Scrum Roles**

We will be using the scrum framework, used to manage the project and roles for the members of the team.
